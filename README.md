Great recipes. Mediocre code.
This is it. One small step for Mark, one giant leap for Georgian cheesebread. Or should that be the other way around? 

After a week of relearning html, it's time to put those brain cells back to good use, but in brutalist code form.

Expect a few simple html pages that link together and demonstrate the ability to add images.

Fun fact - I made a website in html back in school when I was fifteen, so this project was a cracking trip down memory lane.

Also, I didn't have to use Notepad this time around. No offence to Notepad.
